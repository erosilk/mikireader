# The idea:  
Drop an .epub file in the browser and read it in an instant. This works for the moment, but I'm planning on adding more features like:  
* Library of books (saved locally).
* Import books from URL's.
* Make annotations.
* Save book's progress.
* Twitter login.



### Stuff used to make this:

 * [epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/) for processing epub files through JavaScript.
